According to my opinion, making pictures rolling 
to a direction must be include these:

1. The pictures must be loaded finished at first.
2. If want pictures to move, change the style attribution is one of the easiest way. 
    So let the "left/top" of style change to make picture roll 
    in the vertical direction or in the longitudinal direction.
3. If want to keep movement ongoing, js timer is the best choice, 
    setTimeout or setInterval is ok.
4. After confirm basic framework, in order to see better, 
    add some extra effection, for example, stop picture movement
    when mouseover and resume it when mouseout and so on.
